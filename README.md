# simplemilter
This is a very basic milter which checks the domains given by the envelop from
adress and the DKIM signature header, if given. If the domains match, the mail
gets accepted, otherwise it gets rejected.

It is a very simple and *not* production-ready solution. Do just use it for
learning purposes!
